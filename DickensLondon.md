# Charles Dickens' London: A Comprehensive Walking Tour Guide

**From Waterloo Station to Borough Market**

This walking tour follows the footsteps of Charles Dickens (1812-1870) through Victorian London, visiting locations that shaped his life and inspired his greatest novels. The route spans approximately 6.8 miles (11 km) and takes 5-7 hours including stops.

## Before You Start: Route Corrections

**Important Error in Original Route:** Warren's Blacking Factory was **not** located on Villiers Street. The factory operated at two locations: Hungerford Stairs (now demolished, beneath Charing Cross Station) and 6 Chandos Place, Covent Garden (marked with a blue plaque). We'll visit the correct locations on this tour.

**Route Logic Note:** The original route requires some backtracking. For optimal flow, we've reorganized the sequence while preserving all stops.

---

## SECTION 1: The Strand & Covent Garden (Stops 1-5)

### Stop 1: Villiers Street & Warren's Blacking Factory Sites

**Starting Point:** Exit Waterloo Station, cross Waterloo Bridge, head toward Embankment Station

**Villiers Street**  
**Address:** 43 Villiers Street, London WC2N 6NE  
**Nearest tube:** Embankment, Charing Cross

**What You'll See:** A handsome building now called "Kipling House" with an English Heritage blue plaque. But here's the truth: **this building has no Dickens connection**. Rudyard Kipling lived here (1889-1891), not Dickens.

**The Real Warren's Blacking Factory Locations:**

The blacking factory represents the most traumatic period of Dickens's childhood. At age 11 (recent research by Michael Allen at The National Archives corrected the previously believed age of 12), Charles was sent to work here while his father languished in Marshalsea Prison for debt.

**First Location - Hungerford Stairs (1823-1824):**  
**Site:** Beneath Charing Cross Station  
Walk up Villiers Street to the Strand, then to Charing Cross Station. The original factory site lies buried beneath the railway bridge and station, demolished in the 1860s.

Dickens described it vividly: *"A crazy, tumbledown old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars..."*

**Second Location - Chandos Place (January-September 1824):**  
**Address:** 6 Chandos Place (corner with Bedford Street), WC2N 4HG  
**Walking time from Charing Cross:** 5 minutes

From Charing Cross, walk east along the Strand, turn left on Chandos Place. A blue plaque marks the spot where TGI Friday's now stands. When the factory moved here, young Dickens worked in a window where crowds could watch the boys labeling bottles—adding public humiliation to his misery. He worked 10-hour days for six shillings per week.

Dickens wrote decades later: *"For many years, when I came near to Robert Warren's in the Strand, I crossed over to the opposite side of the way, to avoid a certain smell of the cement they put upon the blacking-corks, which reminded me of what I was once."*

**Historical Context:** This experience profoundly shaped Dickens's empathy for abandoned children and the poor, influencing Oliver Twist, David Copperfield, and Little Dorrit.

---

### Stop 2: John Adam Street - Royal Society of Arts

**Address:** 8 John Adam Street, London WC2N 6EZ  
**Walking time from Chandos Place:** 3 minutes  
**Opening hours:** Monday-Friday 8am-8pm; Coffee House 8:30am-5pm

Walk south on Chandos Place to the Strand, turn right (west), then left onto John Adam Street.

**Dickens Connection:** Charles Dickens was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, serving as Vice President and on two committees, demonstrating his commitment to social reform. The RSA building incorporates 18 Adam Street, originally the Adelphi Tavern, which Dickens mentioned in *The Pickwick Papers*.

**Architectural Gem:** Designed by Robert Adam as part of the magnificent Adelphi complex (1774), this building features original Adam ceilings, 14 fireplaces, and the Great Room with James Barry's epic painting series "Progress of Human Knowledge and Culture" (1777-1801).

**Non-Dickens History:** Other distinguished Fellows include Benjamin Franklin, Karl Marx, Marie Curie, and Stephen Hawking. The RSA has championed social progress since 1754.

**Visiting:** The Coffee House is accessible to the public—stop for refreshment and admire the Georgian splendor.

---

### Stop 3: Maiden Lane - Rules Restaurant

**Address:** 35 Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, London WC2E 7LB  
**Walking time from John Adam Street:** 4 minutes  
**Phone:** 020 7836 5314

Walk north on John Adam Street to the Strand, turn right briefly, then left on Southampton Street which becomes Maiden Lane.

**Dickens Connection:** Charles Dickens was a documented regular patron of Rules, London's oldest restaurant (founded 1798). He dined here alongside other Victorian literary giants including William Makepeace Thackeray and John Galsworthy.

**A Living Time Capsule:** Rules has operated continuously for 227 years. The dark wood paneling, deep red velvet, and walls adorned with hundreds of drawings and cartoons evoke the atmosphere Dickens knew. Originally an oyster bar, it specializes in traditional British fare—game, pies, and puddings.

**Historical Anecdote:** Rules remained open even during WWII, serving rationed meals at five shillings. It appeared in *Downton Abbey* and the James Bond film *Spectre*.

**Visiting:** Open daily for lunch and dinner. Smart dress preferred; reservations recommended.

---

### Stop 4: Bow Street

**Location:** Between Russell Street and Long Acre, WC2E  
**Walking time from Rules:** 2 minutes

From Maiden Lane, turn right onto Southampton Street, right onto Russell Street, then left onto Bow Street.

**Dickens Context:** While Dickens didn't live here, Bow Street represents the heart of Victorian justice that he so often critiqued. The area—with its theaters, law enforcement, and seedy reputation—appears throughout his London novels.

**The Bow Street Runners:** Britain's first organized police force (c.1750) operated from No. 4 Bow Street, established by novelist-magistrate Henry Fielding. These proto-detectives predated the Metropolitan Police by nearly 80 years.

**Bow Street Magistrates' Court:** Operating from 1740-2006, this court tried Oscar Wilde (1895), Dr. Crippen, and the Kray Brothers. The building now houses the Bow Street Police Museum.

**Victorian Character:** By the 18th century, Bow Street had declined from genteel residences to brothels concealed behind pubs. Covent Garden's theatrical energy mixed with its criminal underworld—the London Dickens chronicled.

**Today:** The Royal Opera House dominates the street. Stop at the Bow Street Tavern (dating from 1763), which retains connections to the Runners' history.

---

### Stop 5: Wellington Street - Dickens' Magazine Offices

**Address:** 26 Wellington Street, Covent Garden, WC2E 7DD  
**Walking time from Bow Street:** 1 minute

Walk south on Bow Street (which becomes Wellington Street); the building is on the left at the corner with Tavistock Street.

**Dickens Connection - Critical:** This building housed the offices of Dickens's weekly magazine *All The Year Round* (1859-1870) **and his private apartments** following his separation from his wife Catherine. Dickens both worked and lived here during the final decade of his life.

A commemorative plaque marks the building: *"This building housed the offices of Charles Dickens' magazine 'All The Year Round' and his private apartments 1859-1870."*

At the height of his fame, crowds would gather outside waiting for the latest weekly installment of his serialized novels. Dickens described the scene: *"I often looked out of the windows, into Wellington Street; it was often raining, and the cabs in the street were like dark hearses with the life of the people milling around them."*

**Current Status:** The Dickens Coffee House that once occupied the ground floor may have closed, but the building stands with its plaque visible. This is one of the most significant biographical sites on the tour.

---

## SECTION 2: Holborn & Legal London (Stops 6-9)

### Stop 6: The Old Curiosity Shop

**Address:** 13-14 Portsmouth Street, Holborn, WC2A 2ES  
**Walking time from Wellington Street:** 12 minutes  
**Nearest tube:** Holborn

From Wellington Street, head north to Aldwych, continue to Kingsway, turn right on Portugal Street which becomes Portsmouth Street.

**The Novel:** Dickens's fourth novel, *The Old Curiosity Shop* (1840-41), told the heartbreaking story of Little Nell Trent and her grandfather. Queen Victoria called it "very interesting and cleverly written." Legend holds that New York readers "stormed the wharf" when the ship bearing the final installment arrived.

**The Truth About This Building:** Despite the inscription "Immortalised by Charles Dickens" painted on the facade, **this is NOT the shop that inspired the novel**. Dickens himself wrote that "the old house had been long ago pulled down, and a fine broad road was in its place." The actual inspiration was likely a shop in Green Street (now Irving Street) near the National Portrait Gallery, or possibly 24 Fetter Lane.

**How the Confusion Started:** In 1868, bookseller Barnabus Tesseyman painted the name on this building hoping to drum up business. When the building faced demolition in 1883, press coverage cemented the false association with American tourists.

**What Makes It Remarkable:** Built c.1567, this is one of London's oldest surviving timber-framed shop buildings. It survived the Great Fire of 1666, constructed from ship timbers with low ceiling beams and winding staircases. The building is Grade II* listed.

**Current Status:** Temporarily closed (owned by London School of Economics). Worth viewing the extraordinary Tudor exterior.

---

### Stop 7: Sir John Soane's Museum

**Address:** 13 Lincoln's Inn Fields, Holborn, WC2A 2ES  
**Walking time from Old Curiosity Shop:** 3 minutes  
**Opening hours:** Wednesday-Sunday 10am-5pm (last entry 4:30pm); FREE entry

From Portsmouth Street, walk north to Lincoln's Inn Fields, turn right along the south side of the square to No. 13.

**Dickens Connection:** While not directly featured in Dickens's novels, Soane's Museum sits adjacent to Lincoln's Inn where Dickens's great friend John Forster lived at No. 58. Dickens frequently visited the area and would have known this extraordinary building. Soane (1753-1837) and Dickens (1812-1870) were contemporaries in London's cultural life.

**Why Visit:** This is one of London's most remarkable museums—an architect's house preserved exactly as at his death, crammed with antiquities, art, and architectural genius. The Egyptian sarcophagus of Seti I (1824), Hogarth's "A Rake's Progress" series, and Soane's innovative use of space, light, and mirrors create an unforgettable experience.

**Special Experience:** First Tuesday evenings of each month feature candlelit openings (6-9pm)—magical and very popular.

**Historical Note:** Soane was architect of the Bank of England and became a museum by Private Act of Parliament in 1833, making it one of London's oldest public museums.

---

### Stop 8: The Inns of Court - Lincoln's Inn & Gray's Inn

**Lincoln's Inn**  
**Main entrance:** Chancery Lane or Newman's Row/Serle Street, WC2A 3QA  
**Walking time from Soane Museum:** 2 minutes (adjacent)

**Dickens Connection:** Lincoln's Inn is central to *Bleak House* (1852-53), Dickens's devastating satire of the Court of Chancery. The Old Hall housed the Court of Chancery from 1737-1882, the very court whose "fog" opens the novel:

*"LONDON. Michaelmas Term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting in Lincoln's Inn Hall. Implacable November weather... Fog everywhere... And hard by Temple Bar, in Lincoln's Inn Hall, at the very heart of the fog, sits the Lord High Chancellor in his High Court of Chancery."*

The fictional case "Jarndyce and Jarndyce"—consuming entire fortunes in legal fees over generations—became a byword for legal dysfunction. Dickens's criticism contributed to real reform: the Court of Chancery Act was passed in 1852, the very year *Bleak House* was serialized.

**Architectural Highlights:** Old Hall (1490), Tudor Gatehouse (1517-21), Chapel (1620-23) by Inigo Jones. Eleven acres of courtyards and gardens, with continuous records from 1422 (oldest of any Inn).

**Gray's Inn**  
**Main entrance:** Lady Hale Gate, High Holborn, WC1X 8JB  
**Walking time from Lincoln's Inn:** 8 minutes

Walk north through Lincoln's Inn or via Chancery Lane to High Holborn, then west to Gray's Inn Road.

**Dickens Connection - Personal:** From May 1827 to November 1828, 15-year-old Charles Dickens worked as a junior clerk for Ellis and Blackmore, Solicitors at **1 South Square, Gray's Inn**—the only Gray's Inn building to survive WWII bombing. He earned 13-15 shillings per week, delivered documents, kept petty cash, and became a gifted mimic of the lawyers and clients around him.

Despite this formative experience, Dickens later wrote scathingly: *"Indeed, I look upon Gray's Inn generally as one of the most depressing institutions in brick and mortar, known to the children of men... a Sahara Desert of the law."*

Gray's Inn features in *The Pickwick Papers* (Mr. Perker's office) and *David Copperfield*.

**Non-Dickens History:** Founded by the 14th century, Gray's Inn trained barristers for 700 years. Shakespeare's *The Comedy of Errors* premiered in Gray's Inn Hall (1594). Francis Bacon was a prominent member.

**The Walks:** Beautiful gardens open weekday lunchtimes (12:00-2:30pm)—a peaceful escape.

**Visiting:** Grounds open weekdays; buildings generally closed except during Open House Festival.

---

### Stop 9: Royal Courts of Justice & The Seven Stars

**Royal Courts of Justice**  
**Address:** Strand, London WC2A 2LL  
**Walking time from Gray's Inn:** 7 minutes

From Gray's Inn, walk south via Chancery Lane to the Strand; the Gothic Revival building is unmistakable.

**Dickens Connection:** The Royal Courts opened in 1882, twelve years after Dickens's death, but represent the legal reform he championed. These courts replaced the Court of Chancery that met in Lincoln's Inn Old Hall—the corrupt system exposed in *Bleak House*.

**Victorian Gothic Masterpiece:** Designed by George Edmund Street (who died before completion), this massive building required demolishing 450 houses and cost under £1 million. The Great Hall features soaring arches, stained glass windows with Lord Chancellors' coats of arms, and mosaic marble floors. Court hearings are usually open to public viewing.

**The Seven Stars Pub**  
**Address:** 53 Carey Street (directly behind Royal Courts), WC2A 2JB  
**Walking time from Royal Courts:** 1 minute

**Note:** Research found no pub specifically called "Jim's" in this area. The Seven Stars is the historic pub most associated with the Royal Courts and is likely the intended reference.

**Dickens Era:** Dating from 1602, this pub stood throughout Dickens's lifetime. Some sources suggest it may have inspired "The Magpie & Stump" in *The Pickwick Papers*, though this is disputed. Located on Carey Street (nicknamed "Queer Street" due to bankruptcy courts), Dickens would have known this area intimately.

**Living History:** Grade II listed, the pub survived the Great Fire (1666). Low-beamed ceilings, narrow Elizabethan stairs, and a display of bewigged dummy heads from a former wig shop evoke centuries past.

**Today:** Thriving pub popular with barristers and judges. Known for real ales (Adnams, Harvey's) and gastronomic pub food. Run by legendary publican Roxy Beaujolais since 1973.

**Hours:** Monday-Saturday noon-11pm; Sunday noon-10pm. Food served 1-9:30pm. No reservations.

## SECTION 3: Fleet Street - Journalism & Literary London (Stops 10-13)

### Stop 10: St Dunstan-in-the-West

**Address:** 186A Fleet Street, London EC4A 2HR  
**Walking time from The Seven Stars:** 8 minutes  
**Opening hours:** Monday-Friday 10am-3pm; Mass Tuesday 12:30pm  
**Nearest tube:** Temple, Chancery Lane

From Carey Street, head south to the Strand, then east to Fleet Street. The church is on the north side.

**Dickens Connection:** This church's famous clock features in multiple Dickens novels: *Barnaby Rudge*, *David Copperfield*, *Master Humphrey's Clock* (the title may have been inspired by this landmark), and *Nicholas Nickleby*.

**The Striking Clock (1671):** London's first public clock with a minute hand. Two wooden giants (representing Gog and Magog) strike bells with clubs and turn their heads every quarter hour. The clock became so famous that pickpockets worked the crowds who gathered to watch.

**The Clock's Journey:** In 1828, when the medieval church was demolished to widen Fleet Street, the 3rd Marquess of Hertford purchased the clock for his Regent's Park mansion. Charles Lamb reportedly wept when it was removed. Lord Rothermere returned it to the rebuilt church in 1935 for King George V's Silver Jubilee.

**Historic Building:** The current octagonal building (1831-32) survived WWII bombing damage. Inside, discover the statue of Queen Elizabeth I (1586)—the only known statue carved during her lifetime—and a Romanian Orthodox iconostasis from a Bucharest monastery.

**Non-Dickens Literary Connection:** John Donne held benefice here (1624-31) while Dean of St. Paul's. Samuel Pepys worshipped and wrote about it in his diary.

---

### Stop 11: Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese

**Address:** 145 Fleet Street (entrance via Wine Office Court), EC4A 2BU  
**Walking time from St Dunstan's:** 3 minutes  
**Opening hours:** Monday-Friday 11am-11pm; Saturday noon-11pm; Sunday noon-4pm

Walk west on Fleet Street, look for the narrow Wine Office Court alley on your right.

**Dickens Connection:** Dickens was a regular patron. The pub clearly appears in *A Tale of Two Cities* when Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton dine after Darnay's acquittal: drawing "his arm through his own," Carton leads him to Fleet Street "up a covered way, into a tavern... where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine."

Dickens allegedly favored "the table to the right of the fireplace in the ground floor room opposite the bar."

**Historic Atmosphere:** A pub has existed here since 1538; the current building was rebuilt in 1667 after the Great Fire. Vaulted cellars date from a 13th-century Carmelite monastery. The Grade II listed interior features dark wood paneling, sawdust floors (changed twice daily), open fireplaces, and a labyrinthine layout across four levels.

**Famous Patrons:** Dr. Samuel Johnson (who lived nearby), Mark Twain, Arthur Conan Doyle, P.G. Wodehouse, Tennyson, W.B. Yeats. The Rhymers' Club met here in the 1890s.

**Polly the Parrot:** The pub's most famous resident lived here 40 years. On Armistice Night 1918, she mimicked champagne cork popping 400 times before falling off her perch unconscious. When she died in 1926, approximately 200 newspapers worldwide published obituaries, including BBC radio announcement. Her stuffed remains are displayed in a glass case.

**Visiting:** Try the signature steak and kidney pudding. CAMRA's National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors. Not wheelchair accessible (multiple levels, steep stairs).

---

### Stop 12: Dr. Johnson's House

**Address:** 17 Gough Square, London EC4A 3DE  
**Walking time from Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese:** 4 minutes  
**Opening hours:** Tuesday-Saturday 11am-5pm (last entry 4:30pm)  
**Admission:** £9 adults; £8 concessions; £4 children (5-17)

Exit the pub, turn right on Fleet Street briefly, then right into Johnson's Court (narrow pedestrian passage). Follow the winding alley to Gough Square; the house is on your left.

**Important Note:** This house is about **Samuel Johnson** (1709-1784), not Charles Dickens. However, it connects to Dickens in meaningful ways.

**The Dickens Connection:** The current exhibition "Desks, Drudgery and the Dictionary" explores Johnson's dictionary desk with links to Dickens and Thomas Carlyle. Johnson's literary achievements and his famous *Dictionary of the English Language* (1755) created the foundation upon which Dickens built his career. Both men worked in the same Fleet Street area, Johnson a century before Dickens.

**Why Visit:** This Grade I listed Queen Anne townhouse (late 1690s) is where Johnson compiled his monumental Dictionary in the garret (top floor) over eleven years (c.1748-1759). Five stories preserve 18th-century life: original floorboards, paneling, a powder closet for wigs, and the anti-burglary devices on the front door (c.1775).

**Francis Barber's Story:** Johnson's household included Francis Barber, a formerly enslaved Jamaican who arrived aged 10 in 1752. Johnson treated him as an adopted son, paid for his education, and made him his heir. Barber became England's first known Black schoolmaster—demonstrating Johnson's progressive anti-slavery stance.

**Fleet Street Context:** Fleet Street was Britain's journalism heart from 1702 (first daily newspaper, *The Daily Courant*) until the 1980s. Understanding Johnson's world illuminates Dickens's later career here.

**No wheelchair access** (5 floors, spiral stairs). The Hodge the Cat statue outside commemorates Johnson's beloved pet.

---

### Stop 13: Took's Court - "Cook's Court"

**Address:** 15 Took's Court, London EC4A 1LB  
**Walking time from Dr. Johnson's House:** 6 minutes  
**Nearest tube:** Chancery Lane

Exit Gough Square via Johnson's Court back to Fleet Street, turn left (east) past St Dunstan's, turn right onto Fetter Lane, then left onto Cursitor Street. Took's Court is a short cul-de-sac on the right.

**Dickens Connection:** In *Bleak House* (1852-53), Took's Court becomes "Cook's Court"—home to law stationer Mr. Snagsby at No. 15. Dickens describes it beautifully:

*"On the eastern borders of Chancery Lane, that is to say, more particularly in Cook's Court, Cursitor Street, Mr. Snagsby, law-stationer, pursues his lawful calling. In the shade of Cook's Court, at most times a shady place, Mr. Snagsby has dealt in all sorts of blank forms of legal process; in skins and rolls of parchment; in paper—foolscap, brief, draft, brown, white, whitey-brown, and blotting; in stamps; in office-quills, pens, ink, India-rubber, pounce, pins, pencils, sealing-wax, and wafers; in red tape and green ferret..."*

**Historical Significance:** This narrow cul-de-sac, dating from c.1720, sits in the heart of legal London near the Court of Chancery that *Bleak House* so scathingly indicted. Mr. Snagsby, as a law stationer, represents the supporting industry profiting from the legal morass. The Jarndyce v. Jarndyce case consumed entire fortunes in court fees—Dickens's spotlight on this corruption helped spur reform.

**Did Dickens Live Here?** The building is now labeled "Dickens House," and some sources claim he lived here. Evidence is unclear, but as a young parliamentary journalist in the 1830s, Dickens certainly worked extensively in this area.

**Current Status:** Now private offices (including Raymond Gubbay, music promoter). View from the street only—worth the quick detour to see this atmospheric alley.

---

## SECTION 4: Holborn to Clerkenwell (Stops 14-16)

### Stop 14: Staple Inn

**Address:** High Holborn (south side), London WC1V 7PZ  
**Walking time from Took's Court:** 5 minutes  
**Nearest tube:** Chancery Lane

From Took's Court, head north to Holborn Circus, then west on High Holborn. Staple Inn is between Chancery Lane and Gray's Inn Road on the south side.

**Dickens Connection:** Featured prominently in *The Mystery of Edwin Drood* (1870), Dickens's final, unfinished novel. Mr. Hiram Grewgious (Rosa Bud's guardian) lives in chambers here; Edwin Drood visits him for a crucial meeting where he receives a ring; Neville Landless later lodges here.

**Dickens's Description:**  
*"Behind the most ancient part of Holborn, London, where certain gabled houses some centuries of age still stand looking on the public way, as if disconsolately looking for the Old Bourne that has long run dry, is a little nook composed of two irregular quadrangles, called Staple Inn. It is one of those nooks, the turning into which out of the clashing street, imparts to the relieved pedestrian the sensation of having put cotton in his ears, and velvet soles on his boots."*

This remains one of the most perfect descriptions—stepping through the archway today still provides that same sensation of escape from roaring traffic to tranquil courtyards.

**Architectural Marvel:** Built 1585 (some sources say 1576), this is the last surviving Inn of Chancery and one of only four Tudor timber-framed buildings in London. The distinctive black-and-white façade with seven gables survived the Great Fire of 1666 but was severely damaged by a V2 rocket in 1944—carefully restored using original timbers.

Architect Nikolaus Pevsner called it *"no doubt the most impressive surviving example of timber building in London."*

**The PJT 1747 Inscription:** Dickens describes Mr. Grewgious speculating it might mean "Perhaps John Thomas, or Perhaps Joe Tyler." It actually stands for President James Taylor, Principal of Staple Inn in 1747.

**Personal Connection:** As a 15-year-old office boy at Ellis and Blackmore (Gray's Inn), Dickens walked past Staple Inn daily. It was intimately familiar throughout his working life.

**Internal Features:** Two irregular quadrangles with a peaceful garden (fountain installed 1937), Great Hall with Elizabethan hammer-beam roof and Jacobean stained-glass windows.

**Visiting:** Courtyards and garden accessible during daylight hours (FREE). Ground floor shops, upper floors house barristers' chambers. Headquarters of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. Typically a 5-10 minute visit. Wheelchair accessible through courtyards.

---

### Stop 15: Furnival's Inn (demolished) & Gray's Inn

**FURNIVAL'S INN - THE PICKWICK PAPERS BIRTHPLACE**

**Current Address:** Holborn Bars (Prudential Building), 138-142 Holborn, EC1N 2NH  
**Walking time from Staple Inn:** 2 minutes

Turn right (west) on High Holborn; the red brick Victorian Gothic Prudential Building is immediately ahead.

**CRITICAL DICKENS SITE - Now Demolished:** Furnival's Inn was **completely demolished in 1897**. This was Dickens's first independent London home (December 1834-1837). He lived initially at No. 13 with his brother Frederick, then moved to larger chambers at No. 15 after marrying Catherine Hogarth (April 2, 1836).

**Literary Birthplace:** ***The Pickwick Papers* was written here**—the work that made Dickens famous. He also wrote *Sketches by Boz* here. His first son, Charles Jr. ("Charley"), was born here (January 6, 1837).

**Historic Meeting:** On February 10, 1836, publisher William Hall met Dickens here to propose *The Pickwick Papers*. The success of Pickwick established Dickens as "the inimitable Boz."

**What Dickens Wrote:** Character John Westlock in *Martin Chuzzlewit* lives at Furnival's Inn. Dickens described it as *"a shady, quiet place, echoing to the footsteps of the stragglers who have business there... there are snug chambers in those Inns where the bachelors live."*

**Historical Background:** Founded c.1383 as an Inn of Chancery, named after William de Furnival. Sir Thomas More was Reader here (1504-1507). Medieval building demolished 1818, replaced with apartments—this is what Dickens lived in. Finally demolished 1897.

**The Prudential Building:** The current Victorian Gothic masterpiece (1879-1901) was designed by Alfred Waterhouse in red brick and terracotta. Grade II* listed. A blue plaque by the entrance commemorates Furnival's Inn and Dickens's residence. A bust of Dickens is displayed in a glass case inside.

**Visiting:** Courtyard accessible during business hours. Waterhouse Square (interior courtyards) can be viewed. Free to explore.

**GRAY'S INN** - See Stop 8 for full details of Dickens's employment here as a 15-year-old clerk (1827-1828). If you visited Gray's Inn earlier, you can skip it now, though the route passes near the entrance on High Holborn.

---

### Stop 16: St George the Martyr Church

**Route Clarification:** There are TWO churches with this name. The route likely intends **St George the Martyr, Queen Square (Holborn)**, though the **St George the Martyr, Southwark** has far stronger Dickens connections.

**St George the Martyr, HOLBORN**  
**Address:** Queen Square, Holborn, WC1N 3AU  
**Walking time from Furnival's Inn/Prudential Building:** 10 minutes

From Holborn Bars, walk northeast on High Holborn, turn right on Southampton Row, first left into Cosmo Place leading to Queen Square. Church at south end.

**Dickens Connection:** Minimal direct connection. Located in the Bloomsbury area Dickens knew well, but not featured prominently in novels. Built 1703-06, remodeled 1867-69. Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath married here (1956). Grade II* listed. Active Anglican church.

**Alternative:** Many Dickens walking tours skip both St George churches in favor of continuing directly to Southwark, where Stop 17 (Marshalsea Prison) sits adjacent to **St George the Martyr, SOUTHWARK**—"Little Dorrit's Church" with the strongest Dickens associations. This makes more geographical sense.

---

## Route Decision Point

**Recommended Adjustment:** From Furnival's Inn/Staple Inn area, rather than visiting St George Holborn (minimal Dickens connection), proceed directly to **Southwark** for the final, powerful section of the tour featuring the Marshalsea Prison, George Inn, and Borough Market. St George the Martyr Southwark sits immediately adjacent to the Marshalsea.

**How to Get to Southwark:**  
- **Walk:** 30-35 minutes south through the City to London Bridge  
- **Tube:** Chancery Lane → Central Line to Bank → Northern Line to Borough (15 mins)  
- **Combination:** Walk to Blackfriars Station, cross Blackfriars Bridge, walk along Southwark riverside (pleasant 20-minute walk with Thames views)

---

## SECTION 5: Southwark - Dickens's Childhood Trauma (Stops 17-19)

### Stop 17: Marshalsea Prison - The Most Significant Dickens Site

**Location:** Angel Place (off Borough High Street), behind St George the Martyr Church, SE1  
**Library site:** John Harvard Library, 211 Borough High Street, SE1 1TH  
**Nearest tube:** Borough (Northern Line), London Bridge

**What Remains:** The prison was demolished in the 1870s, but **the original southern boundary wall still stands**—a tall brick wall in Angel Place. Access from St George's Churchyard Gardens. A blue plaque marks the site; paving stone information about Dickens's father.

**The Most Important Dickens Location in London:**

On February 20, 1824, **John Dickens was imprisoned here for a debt of £40 and 10 shillings** (equivalent to £4,502 today) owed to baker James Kerr. **Charles was only 12 years old**. This traumatic event profoundly shaped his entire life and literary career.

**Young Dickens's Ordeal:**  
- His mother Elizabeth and younger siblings joined John in prison (as was customary)  
- Charles was sent to work at Warren's Blacking Factory, wrapping bottles for 6 shillings per week, 10 hours daily  
- Initially lodged in Camden (5-mile daily walk), later moved to nearby **Lant Street** to be closer  
- Ate breakfast and dinner with his family in the prison while working at the factory  
- **John Dickens was released May 28, 1824** (after 3 months), but Charles's mother wanted him to continue working—**he never forgave her**  
- Dickens kept this secret throughout his life, revealing it only to his wife Catherine and friend John Forster

**Literary Impact - Three Major Novels:**

1. ***Little Dorrit* (1855-1857):** Most extensive treatment. Amy Dorrit is **born in the Marshalsea**; her father William Dorrit becomes "Father of the Marshalsea" after 22+ years. Every detail reflects the 1820s prison. Dickens couldn't write it until after his father's death and couldn't visit the ruins until finishing the novel.

2. ***David Copperfield* (1849-1850):** Mr. Micawber (based on John Dickens) imprisoned in King's Bench prison. Famous quote: *"Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen nineteen six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds nought and six, result misery."*

3. ***The Pickwick Papers* (1836-1837):** Mr. Pickwick imprisoned in Fleet prison, descriptions drew on Marshalsea experience.

**Dickens's Words:**

Opening of *Little Dorrit*:  
*"Thirty years ago there stood, a few doors short of the church of Saint George, in the borough of Southwark, on the left-hand side of the way going southward, the Marshalsea Prison. It had stood there many years before, and it remained there some years afterwards; but it is gone now, and the world is none the worse without it."*

From his 1857 visit:  
*"Whosoever goes into Marshalsea Place, turning out of Angel Court, leading to Bermondsey, will find his feet on the very paving-stones of the extinct Marshalsea jail; will see its narrow yard to the right and to the left, very little altered if at all, except that the walls were lowered when the place got free; will look upon the rooms in which the debtors lived; and will stand among the crowding ghosts of many miserable years."*

**Historical Context:** Operating 1373-1842 (469 years), the Marshalsea became notorious as London's poorest debtors' prison. In the 18th century, **over half of England's prisoners were debtors**. A 1729 parliamentary inquiry found prisoners dying of starvation (300 deaths in 3 months). Run privately for profit—prisoners charged for everything.

**Visiting:** FREE, accessible during daylight. Walk through St George's Churchyard Gardens to Angel Place. Allow 20-30 minutes for reflection at this profoundly moving site.

**Adjacent:** **St George the Martyr Church, Southwark** (Borough High Street, SE1 1JA)—"Little Dorrit's Church." Amy Dorrit was christened here in the novel. The east window includes a kneeling figure of Little Dorrit designed by Marion Grant. Church built 1734-36, Grade II* listed.

### Stop 18: The George Inn

**Address:** 77 Borough High Street, Southwark, SE1 1NH  
**Phone:** 020 7407 2056  
**Walking time from Marshalsea:** 3 minutes  
**Opening hours:** Standard pub hours (check ahead)

Walk north on Borough High Street; narrow passageway with "The George" sign on right leads to courtyard.

**London's Only Surviving Galleried Coaching Inn:**

**Grade I listed**, owned by National Trust since 1937. Current building dates from **1677** (rebuilt after Great Fire of Southwark, 1676), but the inn existed since at least **1542**. The unique timber-framed architecture with distinctive wooden galleries on upper floors—once common, now London's sole survivor.

**Dickens Connection:**

***Little Dorrit* (1855-1857):** Maggy says of Tip: *"If he goes into the George and writes a letter..."*

***Our Mutual Friend*:** Also references The George.

**Personal Connection:** Dickens visited when it functioned as a coffee house. Miss Murray (former hostess) reported Abraham Dawson, a well-known carman, frequently saw Dickens in the coffee room and "chatted with Dickens" there. During Dickens's time, the Middle Bar was the Coffee Room.

**Historical Anecdotes:**  
- Located on Borough High Street—the main route from London Bridge to southern England since Roman times  
- Near the site of The Tabard Inn (demolished), where *The Canterbury Tales* begins  
- Believed Shakespeare performed here—plays staged in galleried inn courtyards were common  
- 1730s: Lord Digby released 30 Marshalsea prisoners and treated them to dinner at The George  
- Great Northern Railway bought parts in 19th century, demolished two sides, but eventually sold to National Trust (1937)

**Architecture:** Enclosed courtyard accessed through narrow street entrance. First and second floor wooden galleries (external walkways) facing courtyard—the only means of moving between upper floor rooms. Ground floor features multiple interconnected bars including Parliament Bar (former coach passenger waiting room) and Middle Bar (Victorian coffee room).

**Visiting:** Working pub and restaurant operated by Greene King. Traditional pub food, Sunday roasts, multiple real ales. Outdoor courtyard seating. Dog-friendly, family-friendly, free WiFi. Booking recommended for dining. Ground floor accessible; upper floors stairs only.

**Recommendation:** Perfect lunch or drink stop. Try the courtyard for atmosphere.

**London's Oldest Food Market - 1,000 Years of History:**

**Dating back to 1014:** First records of grain, fish, vegetables, and cattle being sold near London Bridge. First formal mention 1276. In medieval times, the market stretched chaotically along Borough High Street—so congested that women selling from baskets weren't allowed to sit down.

**Critical Year 1756:** Southwark residents raised £6,000 (over £1 million today) to purchase "The Triangle" site through Act of Parliament, establishing the market as community space "for the use and benefit of the parish forever."

**Victorian Era:** Current Victorian glass and iron structures added 1851 (designed by Henry Rose)—distinctive market buildings still visible today. Throughout the 19th century, Borough Market was at its height as a wholesale trading hub serving southeast England.

**1990s-Present:** Transformed into renowned food lovers' destination while maintaining wholesale trade.

**Dickens Connection:**

The market was at its peak during Dickens's lifetime (1812-1870). Young Dickens passed through or near the market regularly during his walks from Lant Street to Warren's Blacking Factory and visits to the Marshalsea.

**From *Little Dorrit*:** Dickens described Borough area food stalls:  
*"But glimpses were to be caught of a roast leg of pork bursting into tears of sage and onion in a metal reservoir full of gravy, of an unctuous piece of roast beef and blisterous Yorkshire pudding, bubbling hot in a similar receptacle, of a stuffed fillet of veal in rapid cut, of a ham in a perspiration with the pace it was going at, of a shallow tank of baked potatoes glued together by their own richness, of a truss or two of boiled greens, and other substantial delicacies."*

**Today's Market:**

100+ stalls offering fresh seasonal produce, artisanal cheeses, ethically sourced meats, fresh fish, freshly baked bread, international street food, specialty ingredients from Britain and worldwide, coffee, wine, and beverages.

**Architecture:** Victorian glass and iron railway arches (1851), Art Deco entrance (1930s), parts of Royal Opera House's Floral Hall (moved 2004). Mix of cobblestones and historic surfaces. Three main areas: Three Crown Square, Green Market, Borough Market Kitchen.

**Visiting Information:**

## Historical Context: Dickens & His London

### Charles Dickens (1812-1870)

Born Portsmouth, moved to London age 10. The 1824 Marshalsea imprisonment of his father and his own child labor at Warren's Blacking Factory (age 12) traumatized him permanently, fueling his passionate advocacy for the poor and children throughout his literary career.

**Career Evolution:**  
- **1827-1828:** Law clerk at Gray's Inn (age 15)  
- **1832-1846:** Parliamentary reporter and journalist  
- **1834-1837:** First independent home at Furnival's Inn; *The Pickwick Papers* launched his fame  
- **1859-1870:** Editor and publisher, *All The Year Round* magazine from Wellington Street offices  
- **1870:** Died June 9 at Gads Hill Place, buried Westminster Abbey

### Victorian London in Dickens's Era

**Population Explosion:** 1 million (1800) → 6.7 million (1900). London was the world's largest city and capital of the British Empire.

**Social Conditions:** Extreme poverty alongside industrial wealth, child labor, debtors' prisons, inadequate sanitation, cholera epidemics. Dickens's novels exposed these injustices, contributing to social reform.

**Legal System:** Court of Chancery notoriously corrupt and slow (satirized in *Bleak House*). Dickens's criticism helped spur Court of Chancery Act 1852 and subsequent reforms.

**Journalism Capital:** Fleet Street dominated British publishing and newspapers, where Dickens honed his craft.

## Key Themes for Reflection

As you walk this tour, consider these recurring Dickens themes:

**Social Justice:** From Warren's Blacking Factory to Marshalsea Prison, Dickens's childhood trauma fueled his lifelong campaign against poverty, child labor, and debtors' imprisonment.

**Legal Reform:** The Inns of Court, Chancery Lane, Royal Courts illustrate the legal system Dickens critiqued in *Bleak House*, contributing to real reforms.

**London as Character:** Dickens's London—fog, crowds, contrasts between wealth and poverty, the Thames, gaslight, Victorian streets—becomes a character in his novels. Walking these streets, you inhabit his world.

**Memory and Place:** Many locations (Marshalsea, Warren's sites, Furnival's Inn) no longer exist, yet their plaques and remnants evoke powerful memories. Dickens himself noted places demolished and rebuilt, chronicling a city in constant transformation.
