        <h2>Tour Overview</h2>
        <p>This walking tour follows the footsteps of Charles Dickens (1812-1870) through Victorian London, visiting locations that shaped his life and inspired his greatest novels. The route spans approximately 4 miles and takes 5-7 hours including stops.</p>

        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Warren's Blacking Factory was not located on Villiers Street. The factory operated at two locations: Hungerford Stairs (beneath Charing Cross Station) and 6 Chandos Place, Covent Garden.</p>

        <hr>

        </div>

        <h3><span class="stop-number">1</span>Villiers Street & Warren's Blacking Factory Sites</h3>
        <p class="address"><strong>Address:</strong> 43 Villiers Street, London WC2N 6NE<br>
        <strong>Nearest tube:</strong> Embankment, Charing Cross</p>
        
        <p><strong>What You'll See:</strong> A building called "Kipling House" with a blue plaque - but this has no Dickens connection. Rudyard Kipling lived here (1889-1891).</p>

        <h4>The Real Warren's Blacking Factory Locations:</h4>
        
        <p><strong>First Location - Hungerford Stairs (1823-1824):</strong> Beneath Charing Cross Station. The original factory site lies buried beneath the railway bridge, demolished in the 1860s. At age 11, Charles was sent to work here while his father was in Marshalsea Prison.</p>

        <p><strong>Second Location - Chandos Place (January-September 1824):</strong> 6 Chandos Place (corner with Bedford Street), WC2N 4HG. A blue plaque marks where TGI Friday's now stands. Young Dickens worked in a window visible to crowds, adding public humiliation to his misery.</p>

        <h3><span class="stop-number">2</span>Royal Society of Arts</h3>
        <p class="address"><strong>Address:</strong> 8 John Adam Street, London WC2N 6EZ<br>
        <span class="walking-time">Walking time: 3 minutes from Chandos Place</span><br>
        <strong>Opening hours:</strong> Monday-Friday 8am-8pm; Coffee House 8:30am-5pm</p>

        <p><strong>Dickens Connection:</strong> Charles Dickens was a Fellow of the RSA, serving as Vice President and on committees. The building incorporates 18 Adam Street, originally the Adelphi Tavern, mentioned in <em>The Pickwick Papers</em>.</p>

        <p><strong>Architectural Gem:</strong> Designed by Robert Adam (1774), featuring original ceilings, 14 fireplaces, and the Great Room with James Barry's epic painting series.</p>

        <h3><span class="stop-number">3</span>Rules Restaurant</h3>
        <p class="address"><strong>Address:</strong> 35 Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, London WC2E 7LB<br>
        <span class="walking-time">Walking time: 4 minutes</span><br>
        <strong>Phone:</strong> 020 7836 5314</p>

        <p><strong>Dickens Connection:</strong> Dickens was a regular patron of Rules, London's oldest restaurant (founded 1798). The Victorian atmosphere he knew is preserved in the dark wood paneling and red velvet.</p>

        <h3><span class="stop-number">4</span>Bow Street</h3>
        <p class="address"><strong>Location:</strong> Between Russell Street and Long Acre, WC2E<br>
        <span class="walking-time">Walking time: 2 minutes</span></p>

        <p><strong>Context:</strong> Home of the Bow Street Runners (Britain's first police force, c.1750) and the Magistrates' Court (1740-2006). Represents the Victorian justice system Dickens critiqued.</p>

        <h3><span class="stop-number">5</span>Dickens' Magazine Offices</h3>
        <p class="address"><strong>Address:</strong> 26 Wellington Street, Covent Garden, WC2E 7DD<br>
        <span class="walking-time">Walking time: 1 minute</span></p>

        <p><strong>Critical Site:</strong> Housed the offices of <em>All The Year Round</em> (1859-1870) and Dickens's private apartments after his separation. He worked and lived here during his final decade. A commemorative plaque marks the building.</p>
